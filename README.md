Tired of refreshing the rank-list page from time to time in an ongoing contest just to find out that there are no changes? Not a problem anymore. Rank-Shout will do the job for you.

Rank-shout is a browser extension that observes changes in the rank-list page for several platforms and gives notification for the same if any change has occured. This way, you don't need to waste time refreshing the rank-list ;)
