# Rank-Shout
A Chrome extension that observes changes in a codechef ranklist and gives notification for the same.

## Problem
Whenever we write a contest, we would like the ranklist to update automatically and notify if anyone has crossed us or ranked up.
With this chrome extension, we can open a ranklist page in a new tab. The page will get automatically refreshed and notify if any changes has been done on the ranklist.


## Setup

clone the project, go to `chrome://extensions`, click on `load unpacked` and upload the file. This should give the unpacked version of the extension.
