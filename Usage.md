# How to Use?

Once the extension has been installed, just open the ranklist page that you want to observe in a new tab. The extension will automatically refresh the page in 1 minute intervals and send notification if any changes are recorded.

## Types of Notifications
1. *New user in the ranklist:*

The user can choose between two modes for notification:

1. **Everyone:** In this mode, the user will be notified for every change in the ranklist (i.e: All the notifications above will be shown)
2. **Only me:** In this mode, The user will be notified only if someone crossed him/her in the ranklist (i.e: Only notification 4 will be shown to the user).

In every page, there will be an option for the user to change the mode for rank-shout.

##### Codechef:
When you open a ranklist page in Codechef, you should be able to see this button:

This button will allow you to enable/disable rank-shout.
**Note:** For a contest which has ended, rank-shout is disabled by default.

For selecting notification mode, in codechef you should be able to see the dropdown below the filter options if rank-shout is enabled.

**Note:** '*Only me*' mode can be chosen only if the logged-in user is present in the rankings table.
